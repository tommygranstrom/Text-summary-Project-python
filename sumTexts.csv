Two years after a helicopter crash near the Bombay High offshore oil field killed two pilots, an inquiry by the Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) found that the chopper was flying at a critically low height, without the pilots realising it. The Pawan Hans helicopter was on a training sortie on the evening of November 4, 2015. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had asked AAIB?to conduct an inquiry. The inquiry report, which was made public on Wednesday, said that the main pilot was flying low and that the other did not realise it. After taking off, the Rontappmeyer (RYTYR) helicopter may have faced difficulties as the moon was waning, the report said. The report mentioned that the instructor, Captain E Samuel, wasn?t disoriented and was aware of the low height of the helicopter. He alerted Captain TK Guha a little late, but even after realising that Guha wasn?t able to manage the situation, Samuel did not take control of the helicopter.AAIB recommended that ONGC, which owns Bombay High along with the helicopter operators, identify helidecks from where night flying can take place. AAIB also said that Pawan Hans pilots need to rest sufficiently before flying. Guha was flying during the night after a gap of almost a year, read the report.

Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. Soon afterwards, 45 sites offered free parking but now some of the owners have agreed to pay the property tax instead of offering free parking service. As a result, the list has been trimmed to 26. Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic body?s website ? www.mcg.gov.in. As reported earlier, MCG officials had reviewed the Central government?s notification regarding evaluation of property tax for commercial spaces and that to led to the civic body announcing the clause of tax waiver in lieu of free parking space.The 26 establishments offering free parking are Suncity Business Tower, Paras Twin Towers, MGF The Palm Springs Plaza, Global Foyer, Vipul Tech Square, MPD Tower, Augusta Point, Paras Downtown Tower, Central Plaza and Centrum Plaza ? all located on the Golf Course Road. On MG Road, ABW Tower, Sewa Corporate Park, Garden City Point, DLF Corporate Park, Platina Mall and Vipul Agora Mall will offer free parking. Unitech Cyber Park Sector 39, Unitech Business Zone and Nirvana Country Yard Sector 50 and Unitech Arcadia Sector 49 will also offer free parking.Omaxe City Centre, Omaxe Mall, Raheja Mall, ILD Trade Centre, Omaxe Celebration Mall and the Sapphire Mall on Sohna Road are also on the list.?The MCG had the option of levying a property tax on the basements in commercial centres, but after reading the Central government guidelines, an option was given to building owners that if they did not levy a parking fee on customers, the property tax on basements will be waived. Hence, for the public?s benefit, the MCG has placed ?free parking? boards at these sites for their awareness,? MCG Commissioner V Umashankar said.If the sites mentioned on the list are found levying a parking fee, the public can report complaints on the MCG?s toll-free number ? 1800-180-1817 ? or email to support@mcg.gov.in.;Municipal Corporation of Gurugram on Wednesday said that 19 out of 45 commercial building owners have decided to pay property tax instead of providing free parking to the public. Notably, MCG earlier offered a property tax waiver for building basements if they were used to provide free parking. However, the owners allegedly said that revenues from parking profited them more.
